Mercedes-Benz is a subsidiary of German-based Daimler and the brand is used on luxury cars, buses and trucks. Mercedes focuses its sponsorship spending on events that attract a well-heeled crowd. Its three pillars are golf, tennis and New York’s Fashion Week. The Mercedes F1 team has also dominated the track with five straight Constructors' Championships behind drivers Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Valtteri Bottas. The Mercedes-Benz brand matched its 2017 record of 2.4 million cars sold last year. It was the eighth straight year of record sales, albeit only 9,000 more than the previous year. China is the biggest market with 28% of unit sales, followed by the U.S. (14%) and Germany (14%). Sales in China rose 11%.",

There are nearly 300 Cartier boutiques worldwide that showcase the brand's high-end jewelry and watches. The brand is extremely profitable for parent Richemont, and profits rebounded 16% last year after a 20% fall in 2017, due to the luxury industry slump. Cartier re-opened its flagship store in New York in 2017 after a two-and-a-half-year renovation. The four-story Cartier mansion on Fifth Avenue is part museum and part retailer. The London flagship store got a makeover last year and re-opened in December. A private floor, La Résidence, is reserved for Cartier's best clients and includes a bar, kitchen, dining room and lounge area.",

Pampers is still incredibly profitable for the consumer packaged goods firm. It raised raise prices 4% on average last year to offset higher raw material costs. Pamper's products are used by more than 25 million babies in 100 countries every day, according to P&G.

        "description": "Former Chinese military officer Ren Zhengfei started Huawei with $5,680 in Shenzhen. Three decades later Huawei has grown to a world-leading telecommunications provider, with $109 billion in annual sales, triple what it was five years ago. Huawei boasts 180,000 employees in some 170 countries. With a 20% market share, Huawei is China’s largest smartphone seller and it ranks as the world’s second largest, after Samsung. Despite its success in most of the world, Huawei has not made major inroads in the U.S.; due to security concerns the U.S. government has discouraged U.S. carriers from buying Huawei telecom equipment. Google dealt the brand a major blow when it restricted Huawei's access to its Android operating system and apps after the Trump administration blacklisted the firm.",
